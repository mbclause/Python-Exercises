That is no country for old men. The young
In one anothers arms, birds in the trees,
—Those dying generations—at their song,
The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,
Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
Caught in that sensual music all neglect
Monuments of unageing intellect.

A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
For every tatter in its mortal dress,
Nor is there singing school but studying
And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
To the holy city of Byzantium.

O sages standing in God's holy fire
Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,
And be the singing-masters of my soul.
Consume my heart away; sick with desire
And fastened to a dying animal
Into the artifice of eternity.

Once out of nature I shall never take
My bodily form from any natural thing,
Of hammered gold and gold enamelling
To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;
Or set upon a golden bough to sing
To lords and ladies of Byzantium
